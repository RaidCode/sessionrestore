Session restore
===============
When you select 'where I left off' in the 'On start-up', chrome would restore and reload all the tabs. This leads to slow start-up if you have large number of tabs saved.
This extension restore tabs just like chrome but a tab is loaded only when it is active.Tabs remains suspended till you click on it.</p>

Session restore helps to reach where you left you in a  fast, efficient and smooth way.
